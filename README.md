# Mouse_Study_Challenge
In this project I was provided with dataframes that needed to be merged in order to clean the data and remove duplicates from certain columns before other aspects could be completed. Visualizations of test results of how the tumors of mice changed in size at different timepoints, comparisons of gender information about the mice that were studied, bar charts displaying the types of drug regimens their impact were created, and scatter plots showing the relationships and correlations of the weight of the mice and tumor volumes were developed.
